Plex Batch Audio & Subtitle Switcher
====================================

Overview
--------
A script that allows for changing the default audio & subtitle streams of a TV 
show on a season or series level. Simply put: upon choosing your preferred audio
and subtitle tracks for an episode, this script will iterate through the rest of
the episodes you've specified, switching each to matching tracks.

It is made with ease-of-use in mind - simply run the script and it'll walk you 
through the process.

[python-plexapi](https://github.com/pkkid/python-plexapi),
