Plex Batch Audio & Subtitle Switcher
====================================

Overview
--------
A script that allows for changing the default audio & subtitle streams of a TV 
show on a season or series level. Simply put: upon choosing your preferred audio
and subtitle tracks for an episode, this script will iterate through the rest of
the episodes you've specified, switching each to matching tracks.

It is made with ease-of-use in mind - simply run the script and it'll walk you 
through the process.

Installing Dependencies
-----------------------
**Dependencies:** Python 3, 
[python-plexapi](https://github.com/pkkid/python-plexapi), and 
[pyreadline](https://github.com/pyreadline/pyreadline) if running on Windows.

**Note:** As of this writing, the pip version of python-plexapi is out of date
and unsupported by this script. So, we must install the version directly from 
github. Ensure that git is installed before you run the install command below.

Install on Windows:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
Or on Linux:

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
